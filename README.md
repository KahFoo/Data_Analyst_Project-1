### Description of project:

In this project, combination of dataset as shows above are used to analyzing the HDB resale market in order to determine the factors and parameters that influence prices which consists of market trends, prices, and other key indicators to identify patterns and correlations.

For the analysis, I have been using a variety of data sources, including Singapore's inflation rate, GDP figures, unemployment rates and government policy especially during China-Us Trade War, Covid-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine War to determine how these different factors may be impacting the HDB resale market.

One of the key areas of focus for me has been identifying any correlation between inflation and HDB resale prices. I have been using statistical analysis and econometric models to determine whether there is a significant relationship between these two variables, and if so, how they are related.

Another important area of research has been the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the HDB resale market. I have been analyzing data on sales volumes, prices, and other market indicators to determine how the pandemic has affected the market, and how it may have influenced prices.


### DashBoard Findings:
Based on the dashboard analysis:
- In 2017 the HDB resale market saw a steady demand for HDB flats, with prices remaining relatively stable. However, as the year progressed, prices began to increase as buyers competed for a limited supply of flats. This trend continued into 2018, with prices rising by an average of 3% to 4% per quarter. China-US Trade war seems affected the inflation price and interest rate as well.

- In 2019, the market saw a slowdown in price growth as the government implemented measures to cool the property market. These measures, such as raising the minimum cash down payment for HDB flats, helped to curb demand and stabilize prices. Despite this, prices still increased by an average of 2% to 3% per quarter.

- The year 2020 was a tough year for the HDB resale market, as the Covid-19 pandemic hit Singapore and affected the economy. Sudden surge of unemployment rate are observed and leading to a slowdown in demand and a slight decrease in prices of HDB flats. Interest rate are reduced in order to spur up the economy. However, by the end of the year, the market began to recover, with prices starting to pick up again.

- In 2021, the HDB resale market saw a strong recovery, with prices increasing by an average of 4% to 5% per quarter. This was due to a combination of factors, including low interest rates, pent-up demand, and government measures to support the property market.

- As end of 2022, the HDB resale market has increased drasticly, with prices continuing to rise. This is due to ongoing demand for HDB flats. Government introduced latest cooling measures on 30 September 2022 with aims to moderate demand and ensure that resale flats remain affordable for buyers. Despite the current world economy uncertainty with high inflation rate, the HDB resale market looks set to remain strong in the coming years.

### Future Improvements:
- To apply statistical techniques: Advanced statistical techniques like regression analysis.
- To incoperate ML algorithms to further identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data that may not be immediately obvious
- Incorporate additional relevant data sources (Data on demographics, migration patterns etc)
